# Get Resources

## Local Resources
Twice a year CBS is awarded **Local** HPC ressources that can be freely distributed to our researchers and students. CBS primarily have **Local** Type 1 resources as the reflects our current user needs:


| Name          | System     | Type   | Total CBS Core H (approx.)| Smallest Machine (Core H/hour)  | Largest Machine (Core H/hour) |
|---------------|------------|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| u1-standard   | Type 1     | CPU    | 2,000,000                 | 1                               | 64                            |

## How to get Local Resources

=== "TYPE 1 (UCloud)"
    
    **Students**

    - When you need more/other resources you should contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) to discuss further. 

    **Staff**
    
    - You apply from UCloud by sending a [UCloud grant application](/HPC_Facilities/GrantApp/). 
    
    - Information on machine type selection be found [here](/HPC_Facilities/MachineType/). 
    
    - Otherwise please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/).

=== "TYPE 3 (Hippo)"
    
    **Students**

    - CBS students can only under very specific situation get access to Type 3 HPC. If this is of interrest you are welcome to contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) to discuss further.

    - Please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) if you would like to CBS to request **Local** resources to Type 3.

    **Staff**
    
    - You apply from UCloud by sending a [UCloud grant application](/HPC_Facilities/GrantApp/). 
    
    - In 2023 CBS has a very limited Type 3 resource pool. Type 3 grant applications are therefore only granted after thorough evulation by the [RDM Support](/Contact/).
    
    - For more information please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/).

=== "Other"
    Please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) if you would like to CBS to request **Local** resources to Type 2 and 5.

## Sandbox Resources
CBS researchers wanting to test out HPC systems Type 2 to 5 can gain acess to sandbox ressources by contacting [RDM Support](/Contact/). Find more information [here](https://www.deic.dk/en/Supercomputing/Instructions-and-Guides/Access-to-HPC-Sandbox).

## Grant Applications
Find an overview of currently open application rounds [below](/getresources/#current-calls/). Please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) as soon as possible if you consider applying as we can aid in the application process.

- **TYPE 1 to 3:** Researcher can apply for the [bi-annual application round](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources) for the national HPC resources. 

- **TYPE 5 & other international HPC systems:** Researcher can apply for resources at [LUMI and other international HPC facilities](https://www.deic.dk/en/Supercomputing/International-HPC-Facilities).
