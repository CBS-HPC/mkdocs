## Daily User Support
As Deic **Front Office** at CBS are we in charge off all communications with HPC system adminstrators (**Back Office**) and DeiC.

Ideally, all user requests and troubleshooting should be send to the CBS Front Office(rdm@cbs.dk) as a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) where resulting tickets will be directed accordingly. 

This setup provides a better service to users and saves valuable time for **Back Office** technicians who can concentrate on highly technical issues.
