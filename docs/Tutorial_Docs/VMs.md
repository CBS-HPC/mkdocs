# Access GPUs on UCloud

GPUs are accessible on UCloud through [virtual machines](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/applications/search?q=Virtual%20Machines) hosted by [AAU](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/providers/detailed/aau). The user requires computing ressources for "DeiC Interactive HPC (AAU) / uc-t4 (GPU)" in order to access this application. These can be obtained through a [UCloud grant application](/HPC_Facilities/GrantApp/). Information on hardware specification can be found [here](/HPC_Facilities/MachineType/).
