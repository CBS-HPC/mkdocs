# Conda on UCloud

Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R and [more](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

The following links provides step-by-step guides on how to install and use Conda for R and Python on a range of different UCloud applications (R Studio, VScode, JupyterLab and Terminal App).

Using a Conda environement elimnates the need for re-installing all the needed packages/libraries when starting a UCloud Job.

This approach is also highly useful when running [multi-node Slurm Clusters](/Tutorial_Docs/SLURM/).
