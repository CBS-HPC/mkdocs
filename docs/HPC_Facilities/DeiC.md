# National HPC Facilities

This page provides an overview of the [national HPC facilities (overview provided by DeiC)](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/national-hpc-facilities). 

## Type 1 – Interactive HPC (UCloud)
The type 1 system is mainly focused on interactive computing and easy access for users. The system is made of the YouGene cluster hosted at SDU. CBS staff and students can access the cluster resources via [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/). 

**Get for Type 1 resources [here](/HPC_Facilities/UCloud/#apply-for-funds).**

**More information is found [here](/HPC_Facilities/UCloud/).**

## Type 2 – Throughput HPC
Three Type 2 HPC systems are available (Computerome 2.0,GenomeDK and Sophia). This type of HPC system typically has a large number of cores which can be a mix between cost-effective and calculation-efficient units. Type 2 also has the ability to handle large amounts of data and its main focus is on high-throughput performance.

[Sophia](https://escience.sdu.dk/index.php/type-2-sofia/)

## Type 3 – Large Memory HPC (Hippo)
This type of HPC system focuses on problem solving, with a structure that cannot be easily or efficiently distributed between many computer nodes. This is a type of system that is characterized by typically relatively few cores with access to a large globally addressable memory area. 
Type 3 is hosted and maintained at SDU. For the cluster specs check [here](https://escience.sdu.dk/index.php/type-3-large-memory-hpc/). 

**User guide can be found [here](https://docs.hpc-type3.sdu.dk/).**

## Type 5 – Capability HPC (LUMI)
Type 5 is the European pre-exascale supercomputer LUMI. LUMI is an abbreviation for "Large Unified Modern Infrastructure", and will be located in CSC's data center in Kajaani, Finland. LUMI is one of three pre-exascale supercomputers to be build as part of the European EuroHPC project.

LUMI Capability HPC provides a similar setup to DeiC Throughput HPC but with increased possibilities by virtue of state-of-the-art hardware. Specifically the interconnections between compute nodes is designed to minimize latency thereby addressing the issue of communication induced latency in distributed-memory programs running on separate nodes. Additionally the user can obtain access to large amounts of disk space also with low-latency interconnects. In this way Capability HPC enables computations that are prohibitive with DeiC Throughput HPC due to communication latency.

## Get Resources

### Local Resources
Twice a year CBS is awarded **Local** HPC ressources that can be freely distributed to our researchers and students. 

#### Type 1: 
Currently, CBS primarily have **Local** Type 1 resources as the reflects our current user needs. See [here](/HPC_Facilities/UCloud/#apply-for-funds) to apply.

#### Type 3

#### Other
Please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) if you would like to CBS to request **Local** resources to Type 2 and 5.

### Sandbox Resources
CBS researchers wanting to test out HPC systems Type 2 to 5 can gain acess to sandbox ressources by contacting [RDM Support](/Contact/). Find more information [here](https://www.deic.dk/en/Supercomputing/Instructions-and-Guides/Access-to-HPC-Sandbox).

### Grant Applications
Find an overview of currently open application rounds [here](/GrantApp/). Please contact [RDM Support](/Contact/) as soon as possible if you consider applying as we can aid in the application process.

**Type 1-3:** Researcher can apply for the [bi-annual application round](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources) for the national HPC resources. 

**Type 5 & other international HPC systems:** Researcher can apply for resources at [LUMI and other international HPC facilities](https://www.deic.dk/en/Supercomputing/International-HPC-Facilities).
