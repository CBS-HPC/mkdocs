# Type 1 â€“ Interactive HPC (UCloud)     [![UCloud](/HPC_Facilities/images/hpc_ucloud.png){ align=right}](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/login) 

The easiest-to-use HPC service is DeiC Interactive HPC (Type 1) also known as [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/). 

This service is provided by the Danish universities **SDU** and **AAU** and consist of three HPC systems:


| Institution | System      | User Access       | User-Friendly | Sensitive data |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| SDU/K8      | Kubernetes  | GUI / Interactive | Yes           | Yes            |
| AAU/K8      | Kubernetes  | GUI / Interactive | Yes           | Yes            |
| AAU         | Open Stack  | SSH / terminal    | No            | No             |


## Costs
Machine types are devided into CPU and GPU based machines with their costs being  measured in **core hours** and **GPU core-hours** respectively.

A 1 (GPU) core machine cost 1 (GPU) core-hour pr. hour and a 64 (GPU) core machine cost 1 (GPU) core-hour pr. hour.

=== "AAU"
    
    [AAU](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/providers/detailed/aau) provides primary **GPU** based [virtual machines](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/applications/search?q=Virtual%20Machines). Access is obtained through terminal and [SSH](). It is possible to set up interactive enviroments such as [JupyterLab](https://hpc.ruc.dk/blog/tutorials/setting-up-jupyternotebook-with-gpus-on-aau/).

    === "NO SENSITIVE DATA"

        Virtual machines hosted by AAU are only suitable for the processing of

        - public and,
        - low risk internal data.

        The specific data classification model applicable to your institution should be consulted before using these compute resources.

        AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF AND DELETION

        It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient resources to keep your virtual machine running while you need it. All virtual machines are automatically shut off when the user runs out of resources.

        To restart the machine, additional funds should be requested from your front office to cover the full duration that the virtual machine is shut off, plus any additional compute time.

        All data and information related to virtual machines are IRRECOVERABLY deleted if shut off for:

        - A100 virtual machines: 3 days (72 hours)
        - All other virtual machines: 14 days (336 hours)


        Four different machine types based on different Nvidia GPUs (T4, A10 , A40 and A100) with different application purposes.
