# Type 3 â€“ Large Memory HPC (Hippo)

This type of HPC system focuses on problem solving, with a structure that cannot be easily or efficiently distributed between many computer nodes. This is a type of system that is characterized by typically relatively few cores with access to a large globally addressable memory area. 
Type 3 is hosted and maintained at SDU. 

**The following guide covers the follow:**

## Facility Overview

The DeiC Large Memory HPC system is a system consisting of large memory nodes (between 1 and 4 TB RAM per node) configured as a traditional Slurm cluster. [See here for more information](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/providers/detailed/hippo)

## Get started with Large Memory HPC (Hippo)

The user guide can be found at this [link](https://docs.hpc-type3.sdu.dk/).

## User Support

All UCloud support should go through the CBS front office(rdm@cbs.dk). If problems cannot be solved locally the CBS Front office will take contact to the UCloud system adminstrators (**Back Office**). 

This setup provides a better service to users and saves valuable time for **Back Office** technicians who can concentrate on highly technical issues.

## Apply for Funds

### Students
In order for CBS students to gain  can only have direct access to Type 3 ress the initial 1000kr credit and 50 GB storage. When you need more/other resources, it must go through your thesis supervisor who needs to apply for funds and invite you to join the UCloud project. 

If this is not possible then you welcome to contact [RDM Support](rdm@cbs.dk) to discuss further.

The ressources will be provided within a UCloud project and not to a user "My Workspace".

### Researchers & Staff

Further funds can be obtianed in two ways: 

1. Apply to the local CBS ressource pool. You apply from UCloud by sending a [UCloud grant application](https://github.com/CBS-HPC/.github/blob/main/profile/GrantApp.md). Information on machine type selection be found [here](https://github.com/CBS-HPC/.github/blob/main/profile/MachineType.md). Otherwise please contact [RDM Support](rdm@cbs.dk).

2. Apply for the [bi-annual application round](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources) for the national HPC resources. Please contact [RDM Support](rdm@cbs.dk) as soon as possible if you consider applying.

For both ways the ressources will be provided to a UCloud project and not to a user "My Workspace". Each UCloud project will be given a reference number (DeiC-XX-Y NUMBER).

This number should be used to [acknowledge the use of national HPC](https://www.deic.dk/en/Supercomputing/Instructions-and-Guides/Remember-to-acknowledge-the-use-of-national-hpc) in publications.
