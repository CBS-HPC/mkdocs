# Type 3 – Large Memory HPC (Hippo)     [![UCloud](/HPC_Facilities/images/type3.png){ align=right}](https://docs.hpc-type3.sdu.dk/) 


This type of HPC system focuses on problem solving, with a structure that cannot be easily or efficiently distributed between many computer nodes. This is a type of system that is characterized by typically relatively few cores with access to a large globally addressable memory area. Type 3 is hosted and maintained at SDU. 

The DeiC Large Memory HPC system is a system consisting of large memory nodes (between 1 and 4 TB RAM per node).

**System specifications can be found [here](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/providers/detailed/hippo).**

## Get started

Large Memory HPC (Hippo) is integrated with UCloud which providing an [easy-to-use interface](https://docs.hpc-type3.sdu.dk/intro/ucloud.html).

The UCloud integration provides three base applications RStudio, JupyterLab and Slurm. [See apps](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/applications?tag=Type%203&itemsPerPage=25&page=0).

- RStudio and JupyterLab facilites interactive jobs on a single Type3 node for a range of popular programming languages.

- Slurm provides batch job processing across multiple Type 3 nodes.

**To get resources read [here](/getresources/).**

Start by reading the following Type 3 tutorials:

- [Type 3 user guide (from SDU)](https://docs.hpc-type3.sdu.dk/)
- [Run Stata on Type 3 ](/Tutorials/Type3/Stata/)
- [Use Conda to manage Jupyterlab environments on Type 3](/Tutorials/Type3/Conda_Jupyter/)

## User Support

All UCloud support should go through the [RDM Support](/Contact/). If problems cannot be solved locally the CBS Front office will take contact to the UCloud system adminstrators (**Back Office**). 

This setup provides a better service to users and saves valuable time for **Back Office** technicians who can concentrate on highly technical issues.
